# Landmark-Book
This is a landmark app that shows different significant places in the world such as Eiffel Tower and Taj Mahal. Actually, this is a non-class used version of the Simpsons app. You can take a glance at the Simpsons app in my repository. As in the Simpsons app, I used two view controller screens and UITableViewDelegate and UITableViewDataSource class to build table in my app. Furthermore, I created landmarkNames and landmarkImages array, then using append feature, I added all the names and photos inside them. I also benefited from other functions pertinent to the table view such as numberOfRowsInSection and didSelectRowAt. Finally, I benefited from segue and prepare for segue function to link the two view controller screens.
